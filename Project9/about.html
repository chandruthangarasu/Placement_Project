                <p>Meditech Expanse EHR is a full-featured electronic health record (EHR) system. The software allows healthcare providers to protect data, connect remote sites, communicate with patients, and improve administrative workflows.</p>
                <p>The MEDITECH system is a more efficient and consistent and cleaner way of delivering information to the end user. In the past, we were in and out of modules and screens, and now everything is collected in a way that end users can very easily, with very few clicks, see the relevant information.</p>
                <p>MEDITECH began developing with the MAGIC programming language in 1977 and MAGIC became the proprietary language and operating system upon which MEDITECH's health care information systems were implemented.</p>
